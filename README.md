NFT-Based Academic Credential System 🎓

Overview
The NFT-Based Academic Credential System is a blockchain-powered platform designed to issue, store, and verify academic certificates as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). This system ensures tamper-proof, immutable, and verifiable academic credentials, reducing fraud and simplifying verification.

With blockchain technology, institutions can issue academic certificates as NFTs, making them permanently verifiable, preventing forgery, and eliminating the need for manual verification.

Why This Project? 🤔
📌 Prevent Fake Degrees – Academic fraud is a major issue, especially in smaller cities in India.
📌 Easy Verification – Employers and institutions can verify certificates instantly.
📌 Decentralized & Transparent – Certificates are stored securely on the blockchain and cannot be altered.
📌 Lifetime Ownership – Students own their certificates forever, with no risk of loss.

How It Works 🏗️
1️⃣ Institution Issues NFT Certificate – The issuing authority (e.g., a university) mints an NFT with certificate details.
2️⃣ Stored on Blockchain & IPFS – The certificate metadata (student name, course, date, etc.) is stored on IPFS, while the ownership is recorded on Ethereum Sepolia.
3️⃣ Verification – Third parties (employers, institutions) can verify the NFT certificate’s authenticity directly on the blockchain.

Tech Stack Used 🛠️
🔹 Blockchain: Ethereum (Sepolia Testnet)
🔹 Smart Contracts: Solidity (ERC-721 Standard)
🔹 Storage: IPFS (for certificate metadata)
🔹 Frontend: React.js + Ethers.js
🔹 Development Tools: Hardhat, OpenZeppelin, Remix, Alchemy

How to Use? 🚀
1️⃣ For Students & Graduates:
Claim your academic certificate as an NFT.
Store it securely in your crypto wallet.
Share your certificate NFT link for instant verification.
2️⃣ For Employers & Institutions:
Enter the certificate ID or wallet address of the student.
Instantly verify the authenticity of their credentials.

Pending Tasks 🛠️  
🔸 Frontend Integration – Connect the smart contract with a user-friendly React.js interface.  
🔸 IPFS Storage Implementation – Ensure certificate metadata is uploaded and retrieved correctly from IPFS.  
🔸 Polygon Deployment – Extend support to the Polygon network for lower gas fees and scalability.  
🔸 Testing & Debugging – Conduct thorough testing to identify and fix any remaining bugs.  
🔸 UI/UX Enhancements – Improve the front-end experience for students, institutions, and employers.  

Future Enhancements 🚀  
🔹 Mainnet Deployment – Move to **Ethereum or Polygon mainnet** for real-world use.  
🔹 Institutional Integration – Partner with universities to issue real degrees.  
🔹 Multi-Network Support – Deploy on **Polygon, BNB Chain, and Solana** for broader adoption.  
🔹 Improved UI/UX – Make it even more user-friendly.
